## Description
TipCalculator is my brief foray into mobile development using flutter. A more apt name would be meal splitter.
It makes it easy to calculate how much each person in a dinning party should pay when splitting the bill. Unlike how most people split a bill  this 
app will take into consideration the cost of the meal that each person ordered when spitting tax and tip. 
This allows for the bill to be split fairly between Diners.

For example someone who ordered 40 dollars worth of food would pay a much larger proportion of tax 
and tip than someone who ordered 20 dollars worth of food.
